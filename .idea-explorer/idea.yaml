  title: Do LLMs differentiate epistemic belief from non-epistemic belief?
  domain: nlp
  hypothesis: Large language models may or may not distinguish between epistemic beliefs
    (beliefs about knowledge or truth) and non-epistemic beliefs (such as preferences
    or attitudes), similar to distinctions observed in human cognition.
  background:
    description: Inspired by Vesga et al. that argues humans have different types
      of beliefs, it would be interesting to find out whether LLMs similarly have
      different types of beliefs.
